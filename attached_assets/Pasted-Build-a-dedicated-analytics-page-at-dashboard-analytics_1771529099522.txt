Build a dedicated analytics page at /dashboard/analytics for Travel Lab.

Add "Analytics" to the dashboard sidebar navigation (BarChart2 icon).

─── DESIGN DIRECTION ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

This page should feel like a beautifully designed business report —
not a generic SaaS metrics dashboard. Think: the kind of clean, considered
data visualization you'd see in a premium finance or editorial product.
Generous whitespace. Elegant typography. Restrained use of color.
Charts should be minimal and readable — not colorful for the sake of it.

─── DATE RANGE SELECTOR ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Top right: date range selector.
Options: Last 30 days · Last 3 months · Last 12 months · All time
Default: Last 12 months.
All metrics on the page update when range changes.

─── METRICS TO DISPLAY ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────

ROW 1 — SUMMARY STAT CARDS (4 cards):
  Total Trips Created (in period)
  Active Trips (current, not date-filtered)
  Total Clients
  Portfolio Value — sum of budget_total across all trips in period
    where budget_total is set. Show currency (default USD).
    Label: "Total Trip Value" with a subtle note "(trips with budget set)"

ROW 2 — CHARTS:

  TRIPS OVER TIME (line or bar chart, full width):
    Monthly trip creation volume over the selected period.
    X axis: months. Y axis: trip count.
    Minimal, clean — single line or single color bars.

  TOP DESTINATIONS (horizontal bar chart, half width):
    Most frequent destinations across all trips in period.
    Derived from trip titles or segment location data.
    Top 8 destinations. Clean horizontal bars.

  TRIPS BY STATUS (donut chart, half width):
    Breakdown: Draft / Active / Completed / Archived.
    Minimal legend. Warm, restrained color palette.

ROW 3 — TABLES:

  MOST ACTIVE CLIENTS (table, half width):
    Client name · Total trips · Most recent trip · Total trip value
    Sorted by total trips descending. Show top 10.
    Each row links to that client's profile.

  ADVISOR ACTIVITY (table, half width — only visible to org owners):
    Advisor name · Trips created · Clients managed
    Sorted by trips created. Shows all advisors in org.

─── EMPTY / PARTIAL STATES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────

If an org is new and has little data: show the page gracefully.
Each chart/table shows a minimal empty state rather than broken visuals.
"Not enough data yet — this will populate as you create trips."
Keep the layout intact so advisors can see what's coming.

─── TECHNICAL ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Use Recharts for all charts (already in the project from earlier prompts).
All data fetched server-side, passed as props.
No real-time updates needed — a page refresh is fine for analytics.
