Build a dedicated Preferences tab on the client detail page
at /dashboard/clients/[id].

─── WHERE IT LIVES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Add a tab bar to the client detail page with three tabs:
  Overview (existing content) · Preferences · Documents (built later)

The Preferences tab is what we're building here.

─── PHILOSOPHY ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

This is a living reference sheet Dalila's team keeps on each client.
It should feel like the guest profile a great hotel concierge maintains —
structured enough to be useful, but never so rigid it can't hold nuance.

Every section has structured fields for the common 80% of information,
plus a freeform notes field for the exceptions and outliers that no
dropdown will ever capture. Ultra-high-net-worth clients have highly
specific preferences that must be preserved verbatim.

GENERAL NOTES
  Large freeform textarea — the catch-all for anything that doesn't
  fit the structured fields above. No character limit.

─── EDIT BEHAVIOUR ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The entire tab is in view mode by default.
Single "Edit Preferences" button top right enters edit mode for all sections.
Save / Cancel buttons appear. Saving updates the client record in the database.
All preference data stored as structured JSON on the client record.
Show last updated timestamp below the section header in small text.

─── SURFACING PREFERENCES IN THE TRIP EDITOR ────────────────────────────────

When an advisor opens the trip editor for a client who has preferences saved,
show a slim collapsible panel on the right side (or accessible via a button):
  "Client Preferences — [Client Name]"
  Shows a clean read-only summary: travel style, cabin class, dietary needs,
  key interests, and the general notes field.
  This is a reference panel only — no automation, no auto-suggestions.
  The advisor reads it and uses their own judgment.
  Panel can be collapsed to save space.
