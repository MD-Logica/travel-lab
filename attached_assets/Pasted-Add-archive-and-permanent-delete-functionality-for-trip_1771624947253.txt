Add archive and permanent delete functionality for trips.
Currently the delete route exists server-side but is not
exposed anywhere in the UI.

─── SCHEMA CHANGE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The trip_status enum already includes "cancelled". We will
reuse the existing status field for archiving — no migration needed.
An "archived" status will be added to the enum:

  ALTER TYPE trip_status ADD VALUE IF NOT EXISTS 'archived';

Add to shared/schema.ts tripStatusEnum:
  "archived" as a valid value alongside the existing ones.

─── SERVER: ENSURE DELETE ROUTE WORKS ───────────────────────────────────────

The DELETE /api/trips/:id route already exists at line ~529
in routes.ts. Confirm storage.deleteTrip cascades and removes
all associated versions, segments, and documents.
No change needed here unless cascade is missing.

─── UI: ARCHIVE & DELETE IN TRIP EDITOR ─────────────────────────────────────

In trip-edit.tsx, in the header action buttons area, add a
danger zone dropdown using DropdownMenu. Place it after the
Share button, styled as a ghost icon button with MoreVertical
or a small chevron. Only show to advisors and owners.

  <DropdownMenu>
    <DropdownMenuTrigger asChild>
      <Button variant="ghost" size="icon"
        data-testid="button-trip-danger-menu">
        <MoreVertical className="w-4 h-4" />
      </Button>
    </DropdownMenuTrigger>
    <DropdownMenuContent align="end" className="w-44">
      <DropdownMenuItem
        onClick={() => archiveTripMutation.mutate()}
        data-testid="button-archive-trip"
      >
        <Archive className="w-3.5 h-3.5 mr-2
          text-muted-foreground" />
        Archive trip
      </DropdownMenuItem>
      <DropdownMenuSeparator />
      <DropdownMenuItem
        className="text-destructive focus:text-destructive"
        onClick={() => setConfirmDeleteOpen(true)}
        data-testid="button-delete-trip"
      >
        <Trash2 className="w-3.5 h-3.5 mr-2" />
        Delete permanently
      </DropdownMenuItem>
    </DropdownMenuContent>
  </DropdownMenu>

ARCHIVE mutation:
  PATCH /api/trips/:id with { status: "archived" }
  On success: navigate to /trips

DELETE: show a confirmation dialog first:
  Title: "Delete trip permanently?"
  Body: "This will permanently delete [trip title] and all its
         versions, segments, and documents. This cannot be undone."
  Buttons: Cancel | "Delete permanently" (destructive)
  On confirm: DELETE /api/trips/:id
  On success: navigate to /trips

Add imports: Archive, Trash2, MoreVertical from lucide-react
(check if already imported before adding)

─── UI: ARCHIVED TRIPS ON TRIPS LIST PAGE ───────────────────────────────────

In trips.tsx, archived trips should be hidden from the default
view. Add a toggle below the page header:

  [Active]  [Archived]

Default: Active (shows all non-archived trips)
Archived: shows only status = "archived" trips

Pass a status filter query param to /api/trips:
  GET /api/trips?status=archived
  GET /api/trips (no param = all non-archived)

Update GET /api/trips in routes.ts to accept an optional
?status query param and filter accordingly:

  const statusFilter = req.query.status as string | undefined;
  // If no filter: exclude archived
  // If filter = "archived": show only archived
  const trips = statusFilter === "archived"
    ? await storage.getTripsByStatus(req._orgId, "archived")
    : await storage.getTripsExcludingStatus(req._orgId, "archived");

Archived trips show with a muted style and an
"Unarchive" button (sets status back to "draft").
They also show a "Delete permanently" option.

─── VERIFY ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1. Open a trip → click MoreVertical → "Archive trip"
2. Redirected to /trips — trip no longer visible in Active view
3. Switch to Archived tab — trip appears with muted style
4. Click Unarchive — trip moves back to Active
5. Open a trip → Delete permanently → confirm dialog appears
6. Confirm — redirected to /trips, trip gone from all views
