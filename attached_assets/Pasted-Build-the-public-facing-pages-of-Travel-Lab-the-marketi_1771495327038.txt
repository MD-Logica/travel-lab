Build the public-facing pages of Travel Lab — the marketing site that
visitors see before they sign up. These pages live at the root of the
app and must be visually stunning. This is the storefront.

─── PAGES TO BUILD ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

/ (landing page)
/pricing
/login  (already built in 1.2 — just ensure it's linked correctly)
/signup (already built in 1.2 — just ensure it's linked correctly)

─── NAVIGATION BAR ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Slim, clean top nav. Transparent over hero, white/frosted on scroll.
  Left: "TRAVEL LAB" wordmark in serif
  Right: "Pricing" link · "Log in" link · "Start free trial" button
The "Start free trial" button is the only prominent CTA in the nav.
Everything else is understated.

─── LANDING PAGE (/) ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

HERO SECTION:
  This must be breathtaking. A travel agency owner should land here and
  immediately think: "this is the tool my business deserves."

  Large editorial headline in serif — something like:
    "The itinerary platform your clients will never forget."
  One-line subheading: clean sans, warm and confident tone.
  Two CTAs: "Start free trial" (primary) + "See a sample itinerary" (ghost)
  
  Hero visual: either a beautiful full-bleed destination image with overlay,
  or an elegant device mockup showing the app. Your creative choice —
  make it premium.

SOCIAL PROOF BAR (below hero):
  A slim strip: "Trusted by luxury travel advisors in 12 countries" or similar.
  Logo placeholders for agencies (can be placeholder shapes for now).

FEATURE SECTIONS (3-4 alternating sections below):
  Each section: large elegant headline + body copy + visual (screenshot or
  illustrated mockup). Alternate image left/right.

  Section 1 — Itinerary Builder:
    "Build itineraries your clients will treasure."
    Describe the day-by-day timeline, segment types, cover images.

  Section 2 — Client Portal:
    "A private travel portal, just for them."
    Describe the beautiful read-only view clients receive.

  Section 3 — Multi-Advisor Teams:
    "Built for agencies, not just solo advisors."
    Describe team management, roles, shared client roster.

  Section 4 — Export & Share:
    "PDF itineraries. Calendar exports. One tap."

FOOTER:
  Clean, minimal. Links: Pricing · Log in · Sign up.
  Copyright line. Nothing cluttered.

─── PRICING PAGE (/pricing) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

This page must make the decision feel easy and obvious.

Header: "Simple, transparent pricing." Serif, large.
Subheading: "Start free. Upgrade when you're ready."

THREE PLAN CARDS (side by side on desktop, stacked on mobile):

  TRIAL (Free, 14 days):
    Everything in Pro, limited to:
    - Up to 3 advisors
    - Up to 50 clients
    - Up to 20 trips
    CTA: "Start free trial" → /signup

  PRO ($X/month — leave amount as [PRICE] placeholder):
    - Up to 10 advisors
    - Up to 500 clients
    - Unlimited trips
    - PDF & calendar export
    - Client portal access
    - Priority support
    CTA: "Start with Pro" → /signup?plan=pro
    Visual treatment: make this card stand out as the recommended plan.
    Consider: slightly larger, subtle shadow, "Most Popular" badge.

  ENTERPRISE (Custom pricing):
    - Unlimited advisors & clients
    - Custom branding / white-label
    - Dedicated onboarding
    - SLA + dedicated support
    CTA: "Contact us" → mailto or contact form

PLAN COMPARISON TABLE (below cards):
  A clean feature comparison table showing all three plans side by side.
  Features: Advisors, Clients, Trips, PDF Export, Client Portal, Team Roles,
  White-label, Support tier.
  Checkmarks / limits per column. Elegant, readable.

FAQ SECTION (below table):
  4-6 common questions, accordion style:
  - "Can I cancel anytime?" — Yes, no lock-in.
  - "What happens after the trial?" — You'll be prompted to upgrade.
  - "Can I white-label this for my agency brand?" — Enterprise plan.
  - "Do my clients need to pay anything?" — No, clients access for free.
  - "Can I import my existing client data?" — Yes, via CSV (coming soon).

─── UPGRADE PROMPT (in-app) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

When an advisor hits a plan limit (too many clients, advisors, or trips),
show a beautiful in-app upgrade prompt — not a harsh error.

Design: a modal or inline banner with:
  - Warm, non-alarming message: "You've reached your plan limit for clients."
  - Brief upgrade value prop: "Upgrade to Pro to add unlimited clients."
  - Two buttons: "See pricing" (links to /pricing) + "Maybe later" (dismisses)
  - Never block the user completely — let them view existing data always.

Also: show a slim persistent trial banner at the top of the dashboard
when the org is on trial, counting down days remaining.
"Your free trial ends in 8 days. Upgrade to Pro →"
Disappears when they upgrade. Not annoying — one line, subtle.
