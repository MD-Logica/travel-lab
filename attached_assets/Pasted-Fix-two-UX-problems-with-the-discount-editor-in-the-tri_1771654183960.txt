Fix two UX problems with the discount editor in the trip builder sidebar. Both are in `client/src/pages/trip-edit.tsx` only — no other files need to change.

---

**Problem 1 — Save button doesn't close the editor**

In `handleSaveDiscount` (around line 1919), the function calls `saveDiscountMutation.mutate(...)` but never closes the editor. The row stays open with the Save and Remove buttons still visible after saving, which implies nothing happened.

Fix: In the mutation's `onSuccess` callback, add `setShowDiscountEditor(false)`:

```typescript
const saveDiscountMutation = useMutation({
  mutationFn: async (data) => { ... },
  onSuccess: () => {
    queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["/api/trips", id, "full"] });
    toast({ title: "Discount saved" });
    setShowDiscountEditor(false);  // ← add this line
  },
  ...
});
```

**Problem 2 — Pencil icon is ambiguous; no clear way to re-open or close**

When a discount exists, the toggle button shows only a bare `<Pencil className="h-3 w-3" />` with no label. It's not obvious this is a toggle, what it will do, or that it will open an editor.

Replace the toggle button (around line 2571) with a clearly labeled control:

```tsx
<button
  onClick={() => setShowDiscountEditor(!showDiscountEditor)}
  className="whitespace-nowrap hover:text-foreground transition-colors flex-shrink-0 flex items-center gap-1 text-[11px]"
  data-testid="button-add-discount"
>
  {discountValue > 0 ? (
    showDiscountEditor
      ? <><ChevronUp className="h-3 w-3" /> Close</>
      : <><Pencil className="h-3 w-3" /> Edit discount</>
  ) : (
    "+ Discount"
  )}
</button>
```

Import `ChevronUp` from lucide-react if not already imported.

This way:
- When no discount: shows `"+ Discount"` (existing behavior, already clear)
- When a discount exists and editor is closed: shows `✏ Edit discount` (clear intent)
- When a discount exists and editor is open: shows `∧ Close` (clear that clicking will collapse it)

The Remove button already works correctly — clicking it clears the discount and closes the editor. No changes needed to Remove.
