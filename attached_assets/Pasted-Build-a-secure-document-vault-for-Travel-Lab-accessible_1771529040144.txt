Build a secure document vault for Travel Lab — accessible to both
advisors (upload) and clients (view their own documents only).

─── WHERE IT LIVES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

ADVISOR SIDE:
  A "Documents" tab on each client detail page (/dashboard/clients/[id])
  and within each trip editor (/dashboard/trips/[id]/edit) — both surfaces
  show relevant documents for that client or trip respectively.

CLIENT SIDE (mobile app — add this when building the mobile app):
  A "Documents" tab within each trip detail view.
  Shows only documents attached to that specific trip.

─── FILE TYPES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Accept: PDF, JPG, JPEG, PNG, WebP
Reject all other file types with a clear friendly message.
Max file size: 20MB per file.

─── DATA MODEL ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

trip_documents table:
  id · org_id · trip_id · client_id · uploaded_by (profile id)
  file_name · file_type · file_size · storage_path · label
  (label: advisor-assigned name e.g. "Flight Ticket", "Hotel Voucher",
  "Travel Insurance", "Visa Letter", "Transfer Confirmation")
  is_visible_to_client (boolean, default: true)
  created_at

─── SECURITY — THIS IS CRITICAL ─────────────────────────────────────────────

Every document access — upload, fetch, view, download — must verify
server-side that the requesting user is authorised. Never trust URL
parameters or storage paths alone.

Authorisation rules:
  Advisors: can access documents where trip.org_id = their org_id
  Clients: can access documents where client.profile_id = their user id
    AND is_visible_to_client = true
  No exceptions. Enforce at the API/server level on every request.

Storage paths must not be guessable or sequential.
Use random UUIDs in all storage paths — never expose client_id or
trip_id directly in the file path.

Advisors can toggle is_visible_to_client per document — some internal
documents (e.g. supplier invoices) should not be visible to clients.

─── ADVISOR UPLOAD EXPERIENCE ────────────────────────────────────────────────

Clean drag-and-drop upload area with a "Browse files" fallback.
After selecting a file:
  - Show filename + size
  - Label input: "What is this document?" (required)
    Suggestions as user types: Flight Ticket · Hotel Voucher ·
    Transfer Confirmation · Travel Insurance · Visa Letter · Other
  - Toggle: "Visible to client" (default: on)
  - Upload button

Uploaded documents shown as a clean list:
  File icon (PDF or image thumbnail) · Label · File size · Upload date ·
  Uploaded by (advisor name) · Visibility toggle · Download · Delete

─── CLIENT VIEW (mobile — implement when building mobile app) ────────────────

Documents tab inside trip detail.
Clean list: label, file type icon, download/view button.
Tapping a PDF: opens in-app PDF viewer (expo-file-system + expo-sharing).
Tapping an image: opens full-screen image viewer.
Only shows documents where is_visible_to_client = true.
Never shows internal advisor documents.
